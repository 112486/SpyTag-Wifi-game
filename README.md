# ESP82XX basic project

Simple firmware and tools to experiment with using submodules as a means to share common components between individual ESP8266/85 projects.

ESP82XX-basic is a stripped down version of @cnlohr's esp8266ws2812i2s, who deserves **all** the recognition.
The ESP8266/8285 chips are products of Espressif and are awesome "internet of things" solutions.
